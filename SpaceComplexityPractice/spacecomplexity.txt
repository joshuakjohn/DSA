Space Complexity
Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. 
This includes both the space needed for the input and any extra space used during the computation.

Auxiliary Space: Focuses on the additional memory used by the algorithm, excluding the memory for the input itself.

Common Space Complexities:

O(1): Constant space, meaning the algorithm requires a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.
O(n): Linear space, where the space grows linearly with the input size (e.g., storing data in an array).
O(n^2): Quadratic space, often resulting from storing a 2D matrix or using recursive calls that need to keep track of state.
